This is the second assignment for Practical Python for Data Science which formed part of my Graduate Certificate in Data Science.

Using Kmeans and DBSCAN clustering methods on an employee data set to predict which employees will resign.

The report details the features of the data set, as well as the processes and methodology used selecting features for data modelling, and in evaluating the effectiveness of the parameters used when performing Kmeans and DBSCAN clustering.
